<Main>
    <ParentMain.py>
        - the highest "main" file in this project; does all the processing
        - GUI processing and queueing
        - Operates webscraping functions based on the needs of the algorithm
        - 
    <Efficiency-Calculator>
        - Data structures analysis on calulating complexity speeds of the different structures
            - possibly allows for a swap between different strucutres in order to find the most efficient one
                - basically have a bunch of DS templates and swap between them (stretch goal)
        <ECMain.cpp>
            -


<Webscraping and Googling>
    - figure out why all the links arent opening and pulling the data
    <parsing app>
        - make an app that parses the html/css/js code on the site for the the necessary data
    <common keywords db>
        - start with a training data db of user-selected words that match what is necessary to find the correct data out of the webpage 
        - passes it to the parsing app for use
